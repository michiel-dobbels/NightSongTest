# NightSongTest


This project uses Supabase for backend storage. The required tables can be created in the Supabase SQL editor using the scripts in the `sql` directory.

Run the contents of `sql/profiles.sql` and `sql/posts.sql` in your Supabase project to ensure the `profiles` and `posts` tables exist with the correct columns (including the `display_name` column used by the app).
